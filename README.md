# miniblockchain
This repository is part of a project for the course CI4852: Tópicos Especiales en Computación (Tecnologías Blockchain).

The objective is to develop a P2P application that simulates the behavior of a simplified Blockchain network. This prototype will use block and transaction definitions like the ones used by the Bitcoin network.

# Version 1
The version 1 of the miniblockchain is under the v1 folder. In order to use some scripts, you need to create a virtual environment ant install the `requirements.txt` dependencies via pip.
