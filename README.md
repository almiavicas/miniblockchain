# miniblockchain
This repository is part of a project for the course CI4852: Tópicos Especiales en Computación (Tecnologías Blockchain).

The objective is to develop a P2P application that simulates the behavior of a simplified Blockchain network. This prototype will use block and transaction definitions like the ones used by the Bitcoin network.
